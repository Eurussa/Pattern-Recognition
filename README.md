# Pattern Recognition

## HW1
- Implement linear regression using only NumPy. 
- Then, train the implemented model using Gradient Descent by the provided dataset, and test the performance with testing data.

## HW2
- Implement 1) logistic Regression and 2) Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant by using only Numpy.
- Then, train a model on the provided dataset and finally evaluate the performance on testing data. 
  * Train the logistic regression model using Gradient Descent, not the closed-form solution.

## HW3
- Implement the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms using only NumPy. 
- Afterward, train the model on the provided dataset and evaluate its performance on the validation data
